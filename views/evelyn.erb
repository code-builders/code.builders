  I graduated from the University of Washington with a degree in Law, Societies, and Justice.  I continued my learning with a Certificate in Paralegal Studies and subsequently became a family law paralegal.

  Outside of the office, I enjoy being active, whether itâ€™s through sports, hiking, or trying something new.  Everyday is an adventure.  This translates into the software development realm as each day poses a new challenge and requires unique ways of thinking.  I am excited to continue down this career path and thrive in this dynamic and developing field.
